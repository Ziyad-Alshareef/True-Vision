# Deepfake Detection Models

This directory contains the pre-trained models used for deepfake detection.

## Required Files

The following files should be placed in this directory:

- `deploy.prototxt` - Model architecture for face detection
- `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel` - Pre-trained face detector model
- `EfficientNet-b1_model.dat` - PyTorch model for deepfake detection (optional)

## Downloading Models

The face detection model files will be downloaded automatically when the deepfake detection
system is first used. However, you can also manually download them:

```bash
# Face detector prototxt
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencv/opencv/master/samples/dnn/face_detector/deploy.prototxt

# Face detector model
wget -q https://github.com/opencv/opencv_3rdparty/raw/dnn_samples_face_detector_20170830/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel
```

## EfficientNet Deepfake Detection Model

For the EfficientNet-based deepfake detection, you need to place the trained model file in this directory:

1. Name the file `EfficientNet-b1_model.dat`
2. The file should be a serialized PyTorch model state dictionary
3. The model should follow the `EffNetLSTM` architecture as defined in the detector.py file

If the EfficientNet model file is not found, the system will automatically fall back to a simple
heuristic approach for detection.

## Model Information

- **Face Detector**: Uses a pre-trained SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) model to identify faces in video frames.
  This is the first step in deepfake detection, as we need to locate faces before analyzing them.

- **Deepfake Detector**: When available, uses an EfficientNet-B1 model with LSTM for temporal processing of face sequences.
  The model analyzes facial features to determine if a face is real or generated by AI.

  If the model file is not available, the system falls back to a simple heuristic approach that
  analyzes face geometry to make a basic determination.
